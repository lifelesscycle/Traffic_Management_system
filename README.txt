The rapid urbanization and increasing vehicular population 
have led to significant traffic congestion in cities, resulting in 
longer travel times, increased fuel consumption, and higher 
carbon emissions. This project presents a Smart Traffic 
Management System that leverages map APIs and a hybrid 
predictive model to optimize traffic flow and reduce travel 
times. 
The system integrates real-time traffic data from map APIs and 
historical traffic patterns with a hybrid machine learning model 
combining statistical and deep learning techniques. By 
analysing factors such as time of day, weather conditions, and 
road network data, the model predicts congestion levels for 
specific routes. Based on these predictions, the system provides 
users with optimized travel routes and alternative paths to avoid 
congested areas. 
Key features of the proposed system include dynamic route 
recommendations, congestion heatmaps, and predictive 
analytics for traffic trends. Extensive testing demonstrates that 
the system can significantly improve travel efficiency by 
reducing delays and enhancing traffic flow. This smart solution 
offers a scalable and cost-effective approach to mitigating 
traffic congestion, benefiting commuters, city planners, and 
transportation authorities alike.
